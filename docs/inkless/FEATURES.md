# Traditional Topics

Inkless is an extension of Apache Kafka, and so all existing functionality in Apache Kafka is still present for Traditional topics.
No extra steps are necessary to make use of this functionality with an Inkless enabled cluster.

# Diskless Topics

The Inkless feature is enabled on a per-broker basis by passing appropriate configurations and credentials to reach both object storage and batch coordinate storage.
Once Inkless is enabled on brokers, it can be enabled for individual topics.
Diskless topics have a restricted set of features available, as not all functionality has been implemented and tested.

Currently Diskless topics support:
* Non-Idempotent Produce
* Idempotent Produce
* Fetch
* ListOffsets
* Access restriction via ACLs
* Committing offsets via traditional Group Coordinators
* Transactional offset commits where the Diskless topic appears only as the offset key (`Producer.sendOffsetsToTransaction(...)`)
* Managed replicas with user-defined replication factor (see [Managed Replicas](#managed-replicas))

The following are notable unsupported features:
* cleanup.policy=delete
* cleanup.policy=compact
* Transactional Produce, `AddPartitionsToTxn`, and `WriteTxnMarkers` targeting Diskless topics
* read_committed consumers reading Diskless topics
* Producing to both inkless and traditional topics simultaneously

If not specified above, features are untested and assumed to be inoperable.

## API support

### Diskless topics supported (possibly with limitations)
- `PRODUCE`
    - upload parallelism is underutilized;
    - Diskless topics can’t participate in transactions.
- `FETCH`
    - can't fetch from Inkless and classic topics in the same request.
- `LIST_OFFSETS`
- `METADATA`
    - the output is modified according to client and broker racks.
- `DESCRIBE_TOPIC_PARTITIONS`
    - the output is modified according to client and broker racks.
- `CREATE_TOPICS`
    - Diskless topics cannot be created with the remote storage enabled;
    - when `diskless.managed.rf.enable=false` (default): the replication factor must be `1` or `-1` (resolves to 1);
    - when `diskless.managed.rf.enable=true`: any valid RF is accepted — RF=-1 resolves to `default.replication.factor`, explicit RF values (1, 2, 3, ...) are accepted, and placement uses standard rack-aware assignment;
    - manual replica assignments are accepted only when `diskless.managed.rf.enable=true` (rejected in legacy mode).
- `DELETE_TOPICS`
- `DELETE_RECORDS`
- `OFFSET_FOR_LEADER_EPOCH`
- `DESCRIBE_CONFIGS`
- `ALTER_CONFIGS`
    - the remote storage cannot be enabled for Diskless topics.
- `CREATE_PARTITIONS`
    - manual partition assignments are accepted only when `diskless.managed.rf.enable=true` (rejected in legacy mode).
- `INCREMENTAL_ALTER_CONFIGS`
    - the remote storage cannot be enabled for Diskless topics.
- `ALTER_PARTITION_REASSIGNMENTS`
    - the replication factor can be changed for Diskless topics only when `diskless.managed.rf.enable=true`; in legacy mode (managed replicas disabled) the RF stays pinned and RF-changing reassignments are rejected with `INVALID_REPLICATION_FACTOR`;
    - reassignments for diskless topics are applied immediately (no staged adding/removing) since data lives in object storage and all brokers are instantly in-sync. This includes growing/shrinking the replica set, e.g. increasing a legacy RF=1 topic to RF=3 after enabling managed replicas.

## Managed Replicas

Diskless topics can optionally use **managed replicas** — real KRaft-managed replicas with rack-aware placement. These replicas are metadata-only: they provide deterministic broker assignment and leadership, but there is no inter-broker data replication (data remains in object storage). This is controlled by the `diskless.managed.rf.enable` server configuration.

### Activation

| Config | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `diskless.managed.rf.enable` | `false` | When enabled, new diskless topics accept user-defined RF and partition expansion (`CREATE_PARTITIONS`) allows manual assignments. Existing replica sets are not retrofitted automatically, but operators can grow/shrink them via `ALTER_PARTITION_REASSIGNMENTS` (e.g. bump a legacy RF=1 topic to RF=3). |
| `default.replication.factor` | `1` | Used when RF=-1 is specified. Operators typically set this to match the rack/AZ count. |

### Behavior

| Aspect | `diskless.managed.rf.enable=false` (legacy) | `diskless.managed.rf.enable=true` |
|--------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| RF=-1 | Resolves to 1 | Resolves to `default.replication.factor` |
| RF=1 | Accepted | Accepted |
| RF > 1 | Rejected | Accepted |
| Placement | Single replica (any broker) | Standard rack-aware (`ReplicaPlacer`) |

### ISR Semantics

Diskless replicas require no lag-based catch-up because data lives in object storage, not on broker-local disks. ISR membership is determined solely by broker liveness:
- ISR membership is **liveness-gated** (broker alive/unfenced), not lag-gated
- When a broker is fenced or shut down, it is removed from ISR
- When a broker returns, it is added back to ISR immediately — no catch-up required
- `min.insync.replicas` semantics remain intact

### Partition Reassignment

Diskless partition reassignment is **immediate** — there is no staged adding/removing process because all brokers can serve from object storage instantly. The ISR is set to the active (unfenced, not in controlled shutdown) brokers in the new replica set upon reassignment.

### Controller Metrics

New JMX metrics are available on the active controller (`kafka.controller:type=KafkaController,name=<MetricName>`, e.g. `kafka.controller:type=KafkaController,name=DisklessTopicCount`):

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `DisklessTopicCount` | Total number of diskless topics |
| `DisklessPartitionCount` | Total number of partitions in diskless topics |
| `DisklessOfflinePartitionCount` | Diskless partitions without a leader (leader=-1), typically because no eligible assigned replica is available to lead |
| `DisklessWithoutRemoteStorageCount` | Diskless topics with `remote.storage.enable` explicitly set to `false` — a misconfiguration. Useful during the transition to remote storage consolidation to detect legacy topics that need remediation. Only counts explicit `false`, not absent config. Refreshed on metadata snapshot (default: every hour or 20 MB of metadata records) |

These metrics are tracked separately from classic partition metrics to avoid false alerts — diskless topics may show offline replicas in KRaft metadata while remaining fully available via the metadata transformer.


# Roadmap

In addition to full feature parity with traditional topics, we may add inkless-topic specific features
Listed in no particular order, here are some features that may be added Inkless in the future:
* Broker roles
* Heterogeneous broker capacities
* Batch coalescing/recompression
* Parallel produce request handling
* Zero-Copy cross-region sharing
* Out-of-process cross-region replication
* Cross-Cluster topic sharing
* Column-oriented object formats
