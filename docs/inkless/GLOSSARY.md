# Inkless Glossary

This glossary defines Inkless-specific terms and concepts. For general Apache Kafka terminology, see the [official Kafka documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/).

---

## A

**Availability Zone (AZ)**
A distinct location within a cloud region with independent infrastructure. Inkless uses AZ-aware routing to minimize cross-AZ data transfer costs. See also: [Rack](#rack).

---

## B

**Batch**
In Inkless, a batch refers to a group of producer records from the same topic partition that are written together as part of an object. Batches are the unit of coordination tracked by the Batch Coordinator.

**Batch Coordinator**
A centralized metadata service that manages batch coordinates and ensures total ordering of messages within partitions. Currently implemented using PostgreSQL.

**Batch Coordinates**
Metadata that describes the location of batches in object storage, including:
- Topic and partition
- Object ID and byte range
- Offset range
- Timestamp information

**Batch Coordinate Cache**
A local in-memory cache (Caffeine) on each broker that stores the metadata of recently produced batches. It serves as a metadata cache for improving the performance of fetches. Configured via `inkless.consume.batch.coordinate.cache.*` properties.

**Batch Index**
Another term for the Batch Coordinator's storage layer. In the PostgreSQL implementation, this refers to the database tables that store batch coordinates.

**Born-Classic Topic**
A topic created with `diskless.enable=false`. It stores data on local broker disks and may use classic tiered storage. It can later become diskless through the [Classic-to-Diskless Switch](#classic-to-diskless-switch). Contrast with [Born-Diskless Topic](#born-diskless-topic).

**Born-Diskless Topic**
A topic created with `diskless.enable=true`. It has no classic prefix and no seal (`classicToDisklessStartOffset` is unset). Consolidation is a separate property: a born-diskless topic consolidates when it also has `remote.storage.enable=true`, either at create time or when that flag is set later. Older text sometimes called that combination "born-consolidated"; use *born-diskless* for origin and *consolidating* (or [CDT](#consolidated-diskless-topic-cdt)) for the storage mode. Contrast with a [Switched Topic](#switched-topic), which started as [born-classic](#born-classic-topic).

---

## C

**Classic Topics**
Standard Apache Kafka topics that store data on local broker disks with replication. Contrasted with diskless topics. See also [Born-Classic Topic](#born-classic-topic).

**Classic-to-Diskless Switch**
The protocol that migrates a classic topic to diskless storage by sealing the local log and initializing a diskless log from the committed seal. One of the three features under [TS Unification](#ts-unification--tiered-storage-unification). See [CLASSIC_TO_DISKLESS_SWITCH.md](./CLASSIC_TO_DISKLESS_SWITCH.md).

**Cold Path**
The fetch processing path for lagging consumer requests (data older than the threshold). Bypasses cache to avoid evicting hot data, uses a dedicated bounded executor pool with optional rate limiting, and a separate storage client for resource isolation. See also: [Hot Path](#hot-path).

**Consolidated Diskless Topic (CDT)**
A topic with both `diskless.enable=true` and `remote.storage.enable=true`. Writes go through the diskless WAL; [TS Consolidation](#ts-consolidation--tiered-storage-consolidation) rewrites those WAL segments into classic Kafka log segments and tiers them to remote storage. A CDT is a [born-diskless](#born-diskless-topic) topic with remote storage (at create time or enabled later), or a [switched](#switched-topic) topic. See [DISKLESS_CONSOLIDATION.md](./DISKLESS_CONSOLIDATION.md).

**Control Plane**
The metadata management layer in Inkless, responsible for coordinating batch commits and lookups. See also: [Batch Coordinator](#batch-coordinator).

---

## D

**Diskless Topics**
Topics configured with `diskless.enable=true` that store data in object storage instead of on local broker disks. The core feature of Inkless. See also [Born-Diskless Topic](#born-diskless-topic).

**`diskless_az`**
A marker embedded in the `client.id` configuration to communicate the client's availability zone to brokers. Format: `client.id=<app>,diskless_az=<rack>` where `<rack>` matches the broker's `broker.rack` value. See [CLIENT-BROKER-AZ-ALIGNMENT.md](./CLIENT-BROKER-AZ-ALIGNMENT.md) for details.

---

## H

**Hot Path**
The fetch processing path for recent data requests. Uses the object cache for fast repeated access, with a dedicated executor pool and no rate limiting. See also: [Cold Path](#cold-path).

---

## I

**Inkless**
The name of this Apache Kafka fork implementing diskless topics. Named to reflect the reduced reliance on local disk storage ("ink" = write to disk).

---

## L

**Lagging Consumer** / **Trailing Consumer**
A consumer reading older data (based on batch timestamp age, not consumer lag). These terms are used interchangeably in Kafka literature; Inkless uses "lagging consumer" in configuration names (`inkless.fetch.lagging.consumer.*`).

**Leaderless**
Unlike traditional Kafka where a partition leader handles all writes and most reads (with followers only fetching for replication), Inkless diskless topics have no designated partition leader at the data layer. Any broker can serve produce and fetch requests for any partition. Metadata coordination still requires the Batch Coordinator for ordering. Note: KRaft metadata always includes a leader field for diskless partitions, but the transformer may override routing. With [Managed Replicas](./FEATURES.md#managed-replicas), the KRaft leader and replica assignments become operationally meaningful (deterministic placement, tooling compatibility, metrics), while the data path remains leaderless.

---

## M

**Managed Replicas**
Diskless topics created with `diskless.managed.rf.enable=true` use real KRaft-managed replicas with rack-aware placement. These replicas are metadata-only — there is no inter-broker data replication (data remains in object storage). Unlike legacy RF=1 diskless topics, managed replicas provide deterministic replica assignments, standard Kafka tooling compatibility, and a foundation for topic migration (Classic <-> Diskless). ISR membership for managed replicas is liveness-gated (not lag-gated) since data is in object storage. One of the three features under [TS Unification](#ts-unification--tiered-storage-unification). See [FEATURES.md](./FEATURES.md#managed-replicas) for details.

**Mixed Cluster**
A Kafka cluster containing both classic topics (using local disk storage) and diskless topics (using object storage).

---

## O

**Object**
A unit of data stored in object storage (e.g., S3, GCS, Azure Blob). In Inkless, objects contain batches from multiple partitions.

**Object Cache**
A local in-memory cache (Caffeine) on each broker that stores recently accessed objects. Combined with deterministic partition-to-broker assignment and AZ-aware routing, this achieves per-AZ cache locality. Configured via `inkless.consume.cache.*` properties. See also: [Hot Path](#hot-path).

**Object Key**
The identifier used to locate an object in object storage. Includes a configurable prefix (`inkless.object.key.prefix`).

**Object Storage**
Cloud storage services like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage. Used by Inkless to store topic data durably and cost-effectively.

---

## P

**PostgreSQL Control Plane**
The production-ready batch coordinator implementation using PostgreSQL for durable metadata storage.

---

## R

**Rack** / **Broker Rack**
A logical grouping of brokers, typically corresponding to an availability zone. Configured via `broker.rack`. See also: [Rack Awareness](#rack-awareness) and [CLIENT-BROKER-AZ-ALIGNMENT.md](./CLIENT-BROKER-AZ-ALIGNMENT.md).

**Rack Awareness**
Configuration that enables clients (producers/consumers) and brokers to prefer operations within the same rack/AZ, minimizing cross-AZ data transfer costs. See [CLIENT-BROKER-AZ-ALIGNMENT.md](./CLIENT-BROKER-AZ-ALIGNMENT.md) for detailed implementation and configuration guide.

**Read Amplification**
Reading more data than you actually need. In Inkless, this happens because objects contain batches from multiple partitions—so fetching data for one partition may pull in data from other partitions stored in the same object.

**Read Replica**
A PostgreSQL read replica used to scale batch coordinate lookups. Configured via `inkless.control.plane.read.*` properties.

---

## S

**Storage Backend**
The object storage implementation (S3, GCS, or Azure Blob). Configured via `inkless.storage.backend.class`.

**Switched Topic**
A [born-classic](#born-classic-topic) topic that completed the [classic-to-diskless switch](#classic-to-diskless-switch). The seal splits the log: classic prefix `[0, seal)`, diskless region `[seal, LEO)`. The switch sets `diskless.enable` and `remote.storage.enable` together, so a switched topic is always a [CDT](#consolidated-diskless-topic-cdt).

---

## T

**Tail Consumer**
A consumer reading recent data from near the "tail" (end) of the log. Tail consumers benefit from cache hits and the hot path. The opposite of a [Lagging Consumer](#lagging-consumer--trailing-consumer).

**TS Consolidation** / **Tiered Storage Consolidation**
The pipeline that rewrites diskless WAL segments into classic Kafka log segments and tiers them to remote storage. One of the three features under [TS Unification](#ts-unification--tiered-storage-unification). See [DISKLESS_CONSOLIDATION.md](./DISKLESS_CONSOLIDATION.md).

**TS Unification** / **Tiered Storage Unification**
Internal umbrella name for [Managed Replicas](#managed-replicas), the [Classic-to-Diskless Switch](#classic-to-diskless-switch), and [TS Consolidation](#ts-consolidation--tiered-storage-consolidation). TS unification is not a synonym for TS consolidation.

---

## W

**WAL** / **Write Ahead Log**
A temporary buffer where produced data accumulates before being written as an object to storage. Configured by:
- `inkless.produce.buffer.max.bytes` (default: 8 MiB)
- `inkless.produce.commit.interval.ms` (default: 250ms)

**WAL Segment**
A single write ahead log file that is rotated and uploaded to object storage when full or after the commit interval expires.
