InklessConfig
-----------------
Under ``inkless.``

``control.plane.class``
  The control plane implementation class

  * Type: class
  * Default: io.aiven.inkless.control_plane.InMemoryControlPlane
  * Valid Values: Any implementation of io.aiven.inkless.control_plane.ControlPlane
  * Importance: high

``produce.buffer.max.bytes``
  The max size of the buffer to accumulate produce requests. This is a best effort limit that cannot always be strictly enforced.

  * Type: int
  * Default: 8388608 (8 mebibytes)
  * Valid Values: [1,...]
  * Importance: high

``produce.commit.interval.ms``
  The interval with which produced data are committed.

  * Type: int
  * Default: 250
  * Valid Values: [1,...]
  * Importance: high

``storage.backend.class``
  The storage backend implementation class

  * Type: class
  * Default: io.aiven.inkless.storage_backend.in_memory.InMemoryStorage
  * Importance: high

``client.az.listener.map``
  Cluster-wide mapping from AZ-specific listener aliases to physical availability zone (rack) IDs, used for listener-based AZ routing of diskless topic metadata. Format is a comma-separated list of LISTENER=az pairs, for example SASL_SSL_US_EAST_1_AZ_1=use1-az1,SASL_SSL_US_EAST_1_AZ_2=use1-az2. Every broker should use the same mapping. Listener names are matched case-insensitively (normalized to upper case). Defaults to empty (feature disabled).

  * Type: list
  * Default: ""
  * Importance: medium

``control.plane.batch.coalescing.enabled``
  When true, contiguous same-partition batch runs within a single commit are collapsed into a single row in the batches table via commit_file_v2, reducing control-plane metadata growth for low-throughput producers. Set to true only after all brokers in the cluster have been upgraded to a version that supports reading coalesced rows. Defaults to false for safe rolling upgrades.

  * Type: boolean
  * Default: false
  * Importance: medium

``fetch.lagging.consumer.request.rate.limit``
  Maximum requests per second for lagging consumer data fetches. Set to 0 to disable rate limiting. The upper bound of 10000 req/s is a safety limit to prevent misconfiguration. For high-throughput systems, consider the relationship between this rate limit, thread pool size, and storage backend capacity. At the default rate of 200 req/s with ~50ms per request latency, this allows ~10 concurrent requests. Note: hedge requests triggered by slow fetches are exempt from this limit. In the worst case, effective storage GET rate can reach up to 2x this value.

  * Type: int
  * Default: 200
  * Valid Values: [0,...,10000]
  * Importance: medium

``fetch.lagging.consumer.threshold.ms``
  The time threshold in milliseconds to distinguish between recent and lagging consumers. Fetch requests for data strictly older than this threshold (dataAge > threshold, based on batch timestamp) will use the lagging consumer path. Set to -1 to use the default heuristic: the cache expiration lifespan. This provides a grace period ensuring data remains in cache before being considered 'lagging', accounting for cache warm-up and typical consumer lag variations. Must be >= cache expiration lifespan (see consume.cache.expiration.lifespan.sec). This is a startup-only configuration (no dynamic reconfiguration support). Both threshold and cache lifespan must be set together at startup to maintain the constraint.

  * Type: long
  * Default: -1
  * Valid Values: [-1,...]
  * Importance: medium

``object.key.prefix``
  The object storage key prefix. It cannot start of finish with a slash.

  * Type: string
  * Default: ""
  * Valid Values: non-null string
  * Importance: medium

``produce.max.upload.attempts``
  The max number of attempts to upload a file to the object storage.

  * Type: int
  * Default: 3
  * Valid Values: [1,...]
  * Importance: medium

``produce.upload.backoff.ms``
  The number of millisecond to back off for before the next upload attempt.

  * Type: int
  * Default: 10
  * Valid Values: [0,...]
  * Importance: medium

``consolidation.cleanup.interval.ms``
  The interval with which to run consolidated diskless WAL pruning on each broker.

  * Type: int
  * Default: 300000 (5 minutes)
  * Valid Values: [1,...]
  * Importance: low

``consume.batch.coordinate.cache.enabled``
  If true, the Batch Coordinate cache is enabled.

  * Type: boolean
  * Default: true
  * Importance: low

``consume.batch.coordinate.cache.ttl.ms``
  Time to live in milliseconds for an entry in the Batch Coordinate cache. The time to live must be <= half of the value of file.cleaner.retention.period.ms.

  * Type: int
  * Default: 5000 (5 seconds)
  * Valid Values: [1,...]
  * Importance: low

``consume.cache.block.bytes``
  The number of bytes to fetch as a single block from object storage when serving fetch requests.

  * Type: int
  * Default: 16777216 (16 mebibytes)
  * Importance: low

``consume.cache.expiration.lifespan.sec``
  The lifespan in seconds of a cache entry before it will be removed from all storages.

  * Type: int
  * Default: 60
  * Valid Values: [10,...]
  * Importance: low

``consume.cache.expiration.max.idle.sec``
  The maximum idle time in seconds before a cache entry will be removed from all storages. -1 means disabled, and entries will not be removed based on idle time.

  * Type: int
  * Default: -1
  * Valid Values: [-1,...]
  * Importance: low

``consume.cache.max.bytes``
  Best-effort limit on cached data based on the sum of cached payload byte lengths. When set to a value greater than 0, byte-based eviction is used instead of count-based (consume.cache.max.count). Set to 0 (default) to use count-based eviction.

  * Type: long
  * Default: 0
  * Valid Values: [0,...]
  * Importance: low

``consume.cache.max.count``
  The maximum number of objects to cache in memory.

  * Type: long
  * Default: 1000
  * Valid Values: [1,...]
  * Importance: low

``consume.cross.tier.log.start.cache.enabled``
  If true, the cross-tier log start offset cache is enabled. It caches the EARLIEST offset of consolidating diskless topics to avoid querying the control plane on every request.

  * Type: boolean
  * Default: true
  * Importance: low

``consume.cross.tier.log.start.cache.ttl.ms``
  Time to live in milliseconds for an entry in the cross-tier log start offset cache. A stale entry can only ever be too low (the safe direction), so this only bounds how quickly a retention advance becomes visible from non-leader brokers.

  * Type: int
  * Default: 10000 (10 seconds)
  * Valid Values: [1,...]
  * Importance: low

``cross.tier.log.start.report.interval.ms``
  The interval with which the leader reports the cross-tier (remote) log start offset of consolidating diskless partitions to the control plane. This is dwarfed by remote.log.manager.task.interval.ms (default 30s), which governs how often the underlying remote-retention observation is even produced, so raising this mainly trades off control-plane call frequency, not the effective staleness window.

  * Type: int
  * Default: 1000 (1 second)
  * Valid Values: [1,...]
  * Importance: low

``fetch.data.thread.pool.size``
  Thread pool size to concurrently fetch data files from remote storage

  * Type: int
  * Default: 32
  * Valid Values: [1,...]
  * Importance: low

``fetch.find.batches.max.per.partition``
  The maximum number of batches to find per partition when processing a fetch request. A value of 0 means all available batches are fetched. This is primarily intended for environments where the batches fan-out on fetch requests can overload the control plane back-end.

  * Type: int
  * Default: 0
  * Valid Values: [0,...]
  * Importance: low

``fetch.hedge.total.time.threshold.ms``
  Total time threshold in milliseconds to trigger a hedge request. When a storage fetch has not completed within this threshold, a competing hedge request is submitted. The first request to complete wins; the other continues in the background and its result is ignored. Set to 0 to disable total-time-based hedging. When both hedging thresholds are enabled, this value must be strictly greater than fetch.hedge.ttfb.threshold.ms. Capacity impact: hedges submit to the same executor as primaries (fetch.data.thread.pool.size for hot path, fetch.lagging.consumer.thread.pool.size for cold path). Normal case: only tail-latency requests (exceeding threshold) trigger hedges -- typically <5% of traffic. Worst case: if all in-flight requests exceed the threshold, effective storage GET rate doubles (one primary + one hedge per request), bounded by executor thread pool + queue capacity. Monitor HedgeRequestRate to detect excessive hedging. If hedge rate is too high, increase this threshold.

  * Type: long
  * Default: 0
  * Valid Values: [0,...]
  * Importance: low

``fetch.hedge.ttfb.threshold.ms``
  Time-to-first-byte threshold in milliseconds to trigger a hedge request. When a storage fetch has not received its first byte within this threshold, a competing hedge request is submitted. This catches stuck connections early, before the total-time threshold. Set to 0 to disable TTFB-based hedging. When both hedging thresholds are enabled, fetch.hedge.total.time.threshold.ms must be strictly greater than this value.

  * Type: long
  * Default: 0
  * Valid Values: [0,...]
  * Importance: low

``fetch.lagging.consumer.thread.pool.size``
  Thread pool size for lagging consumer fetch requests (consumers reading old data). Set to 0 to disable the lagging consumer feature (all requests will use the recent data path). The default value of 16 is designed as approximately half of the default fetch.data.thread.pool.size (32), providing sufficient capacity for typical cold storage access patterns while leaving headroom for the hot path. The queue capacity is automatically set to thread.pool.size * 100, providing burst buffering (e.g., 16 threads = 1600 queue capacity ~= 8 seconds buffer at 200 req/s). Tune based on lagging consumer SLA and expected load patterns.

  * Type: int
  * Default: 16
  * Valid Values: [0,...]
  * Importance: low

``fetch.metadata.thread.pool.size``
  Thread pool size to concurrently fetch metadata from batch coordinator. Note: This executor is shared between hot and cold path requests. The hot/cold path separation only applies to data fetching (after metadata is retrieved). A burst of lagging consumer requests can still compete with recent consumer requests at the metadata layer. For workloads with significant lagging consumer traffic, consider increasing this value proportionally to the combined fetch.data.thread.pool.size + fetch.lagging.consumer.thread.pool.size to prevent metadata fetching from becoming a bottleneck in mixed hot/cold workloads.

  * Type: int
  * Default: 8
  * Valid Values: [1,...]
  * Importance: low

``file.cleaner.interval.ms``
  The interval with which to clean up files marked for deletion. Together with file.cleaner.max.files.per.cycle, this interval sets the rate at which files marked for deletion drain.

  * Type: int
  * Default: 120000 (2 minutes)
  * Valid Values: [1,...]
  * Importance: low

``file.cleaner.max.files.per.cycle``
  The maximum number of files a single file cleaning cycle may delete, per broker. Bounds both the control-plane query and the object-storage delete volume, so it also paces deletes: the per-broker delete rate is at most this value divided by file.cleaner.interval.ms, and every broker runs its own cleaner. Keep it above the number of files that can be marked between two cycles, otherwise the backlog grows; 0 means unbounded.

  * Type: int
  * Default: 20000
  * Valid Values: [0,...]
  * Importance: low

``file.cleaner.retention.period.ms``
  The retention period for files marked for deletion.

  * Type: int
  * Default: 60000 (1 minute)
  * Valid Values: [1,...]
  * Importance: low

``object.key.log.prefix.masked``
  Whether to log full object key path, or mask the prefix.

  * Type: boolean
  * Default: false
  * Importance: low

``produce.upload.thread.pool.size``
  Thread pool size to concurrently upload files to remote storage

  * Type: int
  * Default: 8
  * Valid Values: [1,...]
  * Importance: low

``retention.enforcement.interval.ms``
  The interval with which to enforce retention policies on a partition. This interval is approximate, because each scheduling event is randomized. The retention enforcement mechanism also takes into account the total number of brokers in the cluster: the more brokers, the less frequently each one of them enforces retention policy. Together with retention.enforcement.max.batches.per.request, this bounds the sustained deletion capacity per partition, which must exceed the partition's batch creation rate or retention falls behind.

  * Type: int
  * Default: 60000 (1 minute)
  * Valid Values: [1,...]
  * Importance: low

``retention.enforcement.max.batches.per.request``
  The maximum number of batches to delete per partition when enforcing retention. A value of 0 means all eligible batches are deleted in one request, which makes the retention boundary scan proportional to the partition depth and can impact control-plane performance on very deep partitions. A positive value bounds both the boundary scan and the delete to that many batches per pass, so a deep backlog drains over successive enforcement cycles instead of one unbounded request. It should exceed the per-interval batch creation rate: capacity is this value per retention.enforcement.interval.ms. Together, the defaults sustain up to 33 batches/s per partition; a higher batch-row rate needs a proportionally higher value here or a shorter retention.enforcement.interval.ms.

  * Type: int
  * Default: 2000
  * Valid Values: [0,...]
  * Importance: low
