class DeleteRecordsAcrossTiersTest(Test):
    """``DeleteRecords`` on a *switched* (hybrid) consolidating topic must advance the
    topic's earliest readable offset to *exactly* the requested boundary, in a way every
    broker agrees on, and must not reclaim any records the caller did not ask to delete.
    This guards two distinct behaviors: cross-broker EARLIEST consistency and no
    over-reclaim of the classic prefix.

    Cross-broker EARLIEST consistency. ``ListOffsets(EARLIEST)`` for a
    consolidating partition used to be served from the broker-local classic
    ``UnifiedLog.logStartOffset`` while it was still below the seal. With managed
    replicas enabled (``diskless.managed.rf.enable=true``, which consolidation
    requires) ``InklessTopicMetadataTransformer`` advertises a *hash-selected replica*
    as the partition leader for locality-aware reads -- deterministically the same
    replica for every client, and generally a *follower*, not the real KRaft leader
    that holds the writable log. That follower's local classic log start is frozen at
    the switch, so a ``DeleteRecords`` (which advances only the real leader's log start
    and the control plane) left the client-visible earliest stuck at ``0`` forever. The
    fix routes ``ListOffsets(EARLIEST)`` for consolidating topics to the control plane
    on *every* broker (``COALESCE(remote_log_start_offset, log_start_offset)`` from
    ``list_offsets_v1``), which the classic leader keeps current, so the earliest
    advances on whichever replica the transformer routed the client to, and is one
    broker-agnostic value.

    No over-reclaim of the classic prefix. With retention unset, a
    ``DeleteRecords`` before ``delete_before < S`` must remove only ``[0, delete_before)``
    and leave ``[delete_before, S)`` readable, so the earliest settles at *exactly*
    ``delete_before``. The consolidation cleanup used to reclaim the whole classic prefix
    ``[0, S)`` down to the seal instead. On a leader that rebuilt its log from the remote
    tier, the broker-local whole-log start (``UnifiedLog.logStartOffset``, which is a
    per-replica field and is not the local-segment start ``localLogStartOffset``) sits at
    ``S`` and only ever increments, so the RLM remote-retention reclaim floor and the
    become-leader report both read ``S`` and treated it as the cross-tier earliest. The fix
    drives both the consolidating partition's
    whole-log start (``DisklessLeaderEndPoint``) and the RLM reclaim floor /
    become-leader report (``RemoteLogManager``) from the broker-agnostic control-plane
    cross-tier earliest via ``ReplicaManager.crossTierEarliestOffset``.

    The scenario: produce a classic prefix, switch to a consolidating diskless topic
    (sealing at ``S``), produce + consolidate a diskless tail, and let the classic
    prefix tier to remote with its local copies evicted -- so the prefix ``[0, S)``
    lives in the remote tier. ``retention.ms``/``retention.bytes`` are held unset
    throughout so the only thing that can move the earliest offset is the
    ``DeleteRecords`` request. A ``DeleteRecords`` before ``delete_before = S // 2``
    (inside that remote prefix) must then:

    - return the requested boundary as the partition's new log start,
    - advance the client-visible earliest to *exactly* ``delete_before``, identical on
      every broker (served from the control plane, not a replica's local log), and
    - leave the surviving prefix ``[delete_before, S)`` readable and contiguous with the
      originally produced content.

    Leader routing for the write side of ``DeleteRecords``: the op is leader-routed and
    its local leg requires the real KRaft leader, so the broker the transformer points
    the admin client at forwards the affected partitions to their real leader
    (``DisklessDeleteRecordsForwarder``); the leader runs both the local-log and the
    diskless (control-plane) legs authoritatively.

        the delete), the rebuilt leader would report ``S`` and irreversibly delete the
        surviving remote prefix ``[delete_before, S)``. The control-plane value is present
        throughout, so the guard here is that a rebuilt leader prefers it over its own
        seal-valued local start; the override-absent fail-safe (control plane momentarily
        unavailable, RLM falling back to ``findLogStartOffset``) is unit-covered.

        Delete inside the sealed classic prefix, wait for the earliest to settle at the
        boundary, wipe and rebuild the whole cluster from remote, then re-assert the earliest
        is still *exactly* ``delete_before`` on every broker and the survivors are readable
        and contiguous. A short idle after the rebuild lets the rebuilt leader run RLM
        reclaim cycles, so a seal-based over-reclaim would surface as the earliest creeping up

        records below the cross-tier earliest after a ``DeleteRecords``, whether it is an old
        (pre-KIP-392) or a modern client.

        With managed replicas the transformer advertises a hash-selected replica -- usually a
        follower, not the real KRaft leader -- as the partition leader, and the follower then
        serves the read from its local classic log (an old consumer via the
        ``isOlderConsumer && switched`` relaxation, a modern consumer because ``allowReplica``
        is true for it once routed to a non-leader). A follower's broker-local whole-log start
        (``UnifiedLog.logStartOffset``) does not move on a ``DeleteRecords`` (that advances only
        the real leader's log start and the control plane), so a consumer resuming from a
        position inside the now-deleted range
        ``[0, delete_before)`` could read those logically-deleted records straight off the

        path and returns ``OFFSET_OUT_OF_RANGE`` for anything below it, so the consumer resets

        Both client generations are exercised: the 2.2 console consumer the ducker image ships
        (Fetch < v11, empty ``clientMetadata``) and the current one (Fetch v11+). Each asserts
        a seek below the boundary never yields an offset ``< delete_before`` (guard rejects it;
        the consumer resets to ``delete_before``), and the old client additionally checks a read
