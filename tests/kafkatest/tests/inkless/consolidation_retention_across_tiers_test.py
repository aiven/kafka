class RetentionReclaimsAcrossTiersTest(Test):
    """Retention on a consolidating topic must reclaim data from *every* tier.

    Once a born-consolidated topic has drained (WAL -> local -> remote) and the WAL
    is pruned, the early prefix lives only in the remote tier while the topic's
    earliest offset is still 0 (remote serves it). Applying ``retention.ms`` must
    then:

    - advance the topic's earliest readable offset (not just the diskless WAL
      log-start in Postgres),
    - leave the surviving tail intact and contiguous (no over-deletion), and
    - physically remove the deleted remote objects (no storage leak).

    ``retention.ms`` is used (not ``retention.bytes``): on a born-consolidated topic
    cross-tier reclaim is driven by the remote-log retention path, which enforces
    time-based retention in practice; ``retention.bytes`` alone did not advance
    the topic earliest in system tests.

    The outcome is made deterministic with **two age-separated cohorts** and a
    retention *freeze*, rather than trying to land the retention boundary somewhere
    inside a single continuously-produced span (which is impossible to time
    reliably: the drain step alone ages records by an unbounded amount, so any
    boundary that depends on ``now - record_timestamp`` within one span is racy):

    - **Phase 1** (the deletable prefix): consolidated/tiered to remote, then aged
      past ``retention.ms`` during an idle window while the topic still has its long
      initial retention.
    - **Phase 2** (the survivors): a fresh cohort produced *before* the reclaim,
      separated from phase 1 by the idle window so a fresh segment rolls between
      them and the boundary lands cleanly at ``acked1``.
    - **Reclaim**: ``retention.ms`` is lowered so only the aged phase-1 cohort
      expires; ``earliest`` advances to ``acked1`` and the phase-2 tail survives.
    - **Freeze**: the long retention is restored *before* read-back so the surviving
      tail is not creeping under an active ``retention.ms`` window while it is read.

    The control-plane mechanics are unit-covered (``RetentionEnforcerTest``,
    ``EnforceRetentionJobTest``, ``PruneBatchesBelowHighestTieredOffsetV1Test``,
    ...); what is untested below that level is the end-to-end cross-tier reclaim,
    where a bug means either leaked remote data or lost surviving records.
