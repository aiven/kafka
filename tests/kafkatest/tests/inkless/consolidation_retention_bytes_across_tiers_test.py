class RetentionBytesReclaimsAcrossTiersTest(Test):
    """``retention.bytes`` on a consolidating topic must reclaim data from the
    remote tier and advance the topic's earliest readable offset.

    This is the size-based counterpart to ``consolidation_retention_across_tiers_test.py``
    (which drives the reclaim with ``retention.ms``). The distinction matters
    because the two limits are enforced by *different* code paths on a
    born-consolidated topic:

    - The Inkless retention enforcer only measures the diskless WAL batches in the
      control plane (``logs.byte_size``). Once the WAL is pruned that size is tiny,
      so ``retention.bytes`` compared against it never binds and never advances the
      topic earliest -- which is why a naive ``retention.bytes`` test was previously
      inconclusive.
    - The whole-log ``retention.bytes`` for a tiered topic is enforced by the classic
      ``RemoteLogManager``: it sums the not-yet-tiered local tail plus the remote
      segments and, when that total exceeds the limit, deletes the oldest *remote*
      segments and raises ``UnifiedLog.logStartOffset``. On a consolidating topic that
      advance is published to the control plane by ``CrossTierLogStartReporter``
      (``remote_log_start_offset``), so ``ListOffsets(EARLIEST)`` moves off-leader too.

    So the reclaim that this test exercises is genuinely cross-tier: after the
    born-consolidated topic has drained (WAL -> local -> remote) and the WAL is
    pruned, the early prefix lives *only* in remote while the topic earliest is
    still 0. Lowering ``retention.bytes`` below the remote size must then:

    - advance the topic's earliest readable offset past 0,
    - leave a contiguous surviving tail (no over-deletion or corruption), and
    - physically remove the reclaimed remote objects (no storage leak).

    Determinism without wall-clock timing: rather than guess the per-record on-disk
    size, the test measures how many bytes actually reached remote for *this* topic
    (the delta over the pre-produce baseline, since this test is the only producer
    in its window) and sets ``retention.bytes`` to half of that. The
    ``RemoteLogManager`` deletes the oldest ~half by size, so the boundary lands well
    inside ``(0, acked)`` regardless of record size, and the newer half survives.
    ``retention.ms`` is held long throughout so the only thing that can reclaim is
    the size limit.
