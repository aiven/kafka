    (Postgres, alias ``postgres``).

    Per dependency: produce and consolidate a baseline, blackhole every broker's
    traffic to that dependency with an iptables DROP (the deps are standalone
    ducknet containers, so a ducktape test can't docker-pause them), and check:

    - No premature WAL prune while remote is unreachable. Object storage down:
      log_start_offset must not advance while an un-tiered tail exists. Control
      plane down: pruning can't run at all (it needs Postgres), so instead assert
      the broker acks no produce -- a diskless write is acked only once its offsets
      are durably committed, so nothing acked can be lost.
    - Catch-up after recovery: lag drains, the tiered tier grows, pruning resumes.
    - No data loss: every record acked before and after the outage is readable
      from offset 0.
