# Inkless Upstream Sync Tooling

This directory contains scripts and configuration for syncing inkless with upstream Apache Kafka.

## Overview

The sync process follows the [Versioning Strategy](../docs/inkless/VERSIONING-STRATEGY.md):
- Uses **merge commits** (not rebase) for velocity
- Preserves inkless-specific features and configurations
- Creates structured commits for different types of adaptations

## AI-Assisted Sync (Recommended)

Start a sync session with Claude Code using the appropriate prompt:
- **Main Sync** → [MAIN-SYNC-PROMPT.md](MAIN-SYNC-PROMPT.md) — weekly/biweekly sync with Apache Kafka trunk
- **Release Sync** → [RELEASE-SYNC-PROMPT.md](RELEASE-SYNC-PROMPT.md) — sync release branches with upstream patches
- **Cherry-pick Sync** → [CHERRY-PICK-SYNC-GUIDE.md](CHERRY-PICK-SYNC-GUIDE.md) — backport inkless features from main to release branches

Context for the agent:
- Scripts are in `inkless-sync/`
- Session files track in-progress work in `.inkless-sync/` (gitignored)
- Completed session logs are archived to `inkless-sync/sessions/`
- Action plans have file-by-file playbooks

## Scripts Overview

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `main-sync.sh` | Sync main branch with Apache Kafka trunk |
| `release-sync.sh` | Sync release branches with upstream patch releases |
| `sync-status.sh` | Check how far behind branches are from upstream |
| `branch-consistency.sh` | Check if inkless commits from main are in release branches |
| `create-release-branch.sh` | Create new inkless release branches |
| `cherry-pick-to-release.sh` | Cherry-pick inkless commits to release branches |

## Three Types of Sync

| Type | Branch | Script | Use Case |
|------|--------|--------|----------|
| **Main Sync** | `main` | `main-sync.sh` | Weekly/biweekly sync with Apache Kafka trunk |
| **Release Sync** | `inkless-4.0`, etc. | `release-sync.sh` | Sync release branches with upstream patch releases |
| **Cherry-pick Sync** | `inkless-4.0`, etc. | `cherry-pick-to-release.sh` | Backport inkless features from main to release branches |

### When to Use Each

- **Main Sync**: Regular development sync to keep up with Apache Kafka trunk
- **Release Sync**: When Apache releases a patch (e.g., 4.0.1) and we need to incorporate fixes into our release branch
- **Cherry-pick Sync**: When inkless features land on main and need to be backported to active release branches

## Quick Start

### Regular Weekly/Biweekly Sync

```bash
# Sync with latest apache/kafka trunk
./inkless-sync/main-sync.sh
```

### Pin main to a release-branch cut

```bash
# Last trunk commit that is also on apache/4.3 (4.3.0-SNAPSHOT).
# Use this to cut inkless-4.3; do not pass 4.4.
./inkless-sync/main-sync.sh --before-version 4.3
```

`--before-version 4.3` is the merge base of `apache/trunk` and `apache/4.3`, not a
tag parent. Trunk commits after that cut never landed on `apache/4.3` (or landed
later as cherry-picks with different SHAs). Merging them into main would put them
on `inkless-4.3`.

### Dry Run (Preview)

```bash
# See what would happen without making changes
./inkless-sync/main-sync.sh --dry-run
```

### Release Branch Sync

```bash
# List available upstream release tags
./inkless-sync/release-sync.sh inkless-4.0 --list-tags

# Sync inkless-4.0 to Apache Kafka 4.0.1
./inkless-sync/release-sync.sh inkless-4.0 --to-tag 4.0.1
```

For detailed release sync workflow, see [RELEASE-SYNC-GUIDE.md](RELEASE-SYNC-GUIDE.md).

### Check Sync Status

```bash
# Check how far behind main is from upstream trunk
./inkless-sync/sync-status.sh main

# Check release branch status
./inkless-sync/sync-status.sh inkless-4.0

# Check all branches
./inkless-sync/sync-status.sh --all
```

### Branch Consistency Check

Check if inkless commits from main have been cherry-picked to release branches:

```bash
# Check inkless-4.0 consistency with main
./inkless-sync/branch-consistency.sh inkless-4.0

# Show missing commits with cherry-pick commands
./inkless-sync/branch-consistency.sh inkless-4.0 --missing

# Show ALL missing commits (including old ones that were intentionally skipped)
./inkless-sync/branch-consistency.sh inkless-4.0 --missing --all
```

### Create New Release Branch

```bash
# Create inkless-4.2 from main (main must be at 4.2.0-inkless-SNAPSHOT or later)
./inkless-sync/create-release-branch.sh 4.2

# Preview what would happen
./inkless-sync/create-release-branch.sh 4.2 --dry-run

# Force creation even if version doesn't match
./inkless-sync/create-release-branch.sh 4.2 --force
```

After creating the branch, sync with upstream to set the release version:
```bash
./inkless-sync/release-sync.sh inkless-4.2 --to-tag 4.2.0
```

### Cherry-pick to Release Branches

```bash
# Cherry-pick all missing inkless commits to inkless-4.0
./inkless-sync/cherry-pick-to-release.sh inkless-4.0

# Preview what would be cherry-picked
./inkless-sync/cherry-pick-to-release.sh inkless-4.0 --dry-run

# Cherry-pick specific commits
./inkless-sync/cherry-pick-to-release.sh inkless-4.0 abc123 def456
```

## How It Works (Main Sync)

### Phase 1: Preparation
1. Fetches upstream apache/kafka
2. Determines sync target (trunk HEAD, or trunk's merge base with the
   `--before-version` release branch)
3. Generates "inkless manifest" - list of files we've modified
4. Creates sync branch: `sync/upstream-YYYYMMDD`

### Phase 2: Merge
1. Executes `git merge` from upstream
2. Categorizes conflicts:
   - **Protected**: Files in `storage/inkless/`, `docs/inkless/`, etc. → Use "ours"
   - **Auto-resolvable**: Import conflicts, trivial changes → Auto-resolve
   - **Manual**: Complex conflicts → Stop and ask for human help
3. Completes merge commit or reports conflicts needing attention

### Phase 3: Adaptation
1. Compiles the codebase
2. Analyzes any compilation errors
3. Errors should be fixed and committed as: `sync(compile): fix compilation errors`

### Phase 4: Verification
1. Runs inkless-specific tests
2. Verifies inkless features are preserved (manifest check)
3. Generates sync report

```

Merge protection is driven by the repo-root [`INKLESS_OWNERSHIP`](../INKLESS_OWNERSHIP)
manifest (see below), not a file under `config/`.

During sync, a `.inkless-sync/` working directory (gitignored) is created with:
```
.inkless-sync/
├── SESSION-YYYY-MM-DD.md         # In-progress session file (main sync)
├── RELEASE-SESSION-{branch}-{date}.md  # In-progress session file (release sync)
├── sync-info.txt                 # Sync metadata
├── manifest-files.txt            # Files modified by inkless
├── manifest-stats.txt            # Diff stats from merge base
├── conflicted-files.txt          # Files with conflicts
├── conflicts-protected.txt       # Protected file conflicts
├── conflicts-auto-resolvable.txt # Auto-resolvable conflicts
├── conflicts-manual.txt          # Conflicts needing manual resolution
├── compile-output.txt            # Compilation output
├── compile-errors.txt            # Extracted compilation errors
└── SYNC-REPORT.md               # Final sync report
```

After a sync completes, move the session file to `inkless-sync/sessions/` for permanent record:
```bash
mv .inkless-sync/SESSION-YYYY-MM-DD.md inkless-sync/sessions/
```

## Configuration

### Protected patterns (from `INKLESS_OWNERSHIP`)

The auto-resolve set is derived from the repo-root [`INKLESS_OWNERSHIP`](../INKLESS_OWNERSHIP)
manifest — there is no separate patterns file. The sync extracts the **OWNED** globs
(entries whose sole owner is `@aiven/inkless`) via the `owned_patterns()` helper in
[`lib/common.sh`](lib/common.sh) and auto-resolves those with "ours" during conflicts.

**INTERLEAVED** entries (dual-owner `@aiven/inkless @apache/kafka` — upstream files carrying
inkless edits, e.g. `ReplicaManager.scala`) are intentionally excluded, so they fall into
manual review. To change what is protected, edit `INKLESS_OWNERSHIP`.

### Adding Apache Remote

If you don't have the apache remote configured:

```bash
git remote add apache https://github.com/apache/kafka.git
git fetch apache
```

## Commit Convention

After sync, use these commit message prefixes:

| Prefix | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `merge:` | The merge commit itself |
| `sync(compile):` | Fixing compilation errors from API changes |
| `sync(test):` | Fixing test infrastructure changes |
| `sync(config):` | Preserving inkless configurations |
| `sync(verify):` | Verification and manifest updates |

Example:
```bash
git commit -m "sync(compile): adapt to KafkaMetricsGroup constructor change"
git commit -m "sync(test): add NoOpRemoteLogMetadataManager to test config"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Manual Conflicts

If the script reports manual conflicts:

1. Check `.inkless-sync/conflicts-manual.txt` for the list
2. Resolve each conflict manually
3. `git add <resolved-files>`
4. `git commit` to complete the merge
5. Continue with adaptation phase

### Compilation Errors

1. Check `.inkless-sync/compile-errors.txt` for error list
2. Fix errors in logical groups
3. Commit each group: `git commit -m "sync(compile): <description>"`

### Test Failures

1. Check test output in `.inkless-sync/test-*-output.txt`
2. Fix failures
3. Commit: `git commit -m "sync(test): <description>"`

## Agent Usage

This script is designed to be run by an automated agent (e.g., Claude):

1. Agent runs `./inkless-sync/main-sync.sh`
2. If manual conflicts: Agent reports to human via PR/issue
3. If compilation errors: Agent attempts fixes, commits separately
4. If test failures: Agent analyzes and fixes or reports
5. Agent creates PR with sync report

The structured commit approach makes it easy to:
- Review what changed and why
- Revert specific fixes if needed
- Understand the sync process
