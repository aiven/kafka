Usage: $(basename "$0") [OPTIONS] <release-branch>

Check if inkless-specific commits from main are present in a release branch.

Arguments:
  release-branch    The release branch to check (e.g., inkless-4.0)

Options:
  --missing         Show only missing commits (not yet cherry-picked)
  --all             Show ALL missing commits (including old ones)
                    By default, only shows commits newer than last cherry-picked
  --check           Exit non-zero if there are actionable missing commits
                    (old below-window commits do not count). For CI gates.
  --verbose         Show detailed commit information
  -h, --help        Show this help

Examples:
  # Check inkless-4.0 consistency with main
  $(basename "$0") inkless-4.0

  # Show only missing commits
  $(basename "$0") inkless-4.0 --missing

  # CI gate: nonzero exit when the branch is behind
  $(basename "$0") inkless-4.0 --check

  # Verbose output with commit details
  $(basename "$0") inkless-4.0 --verbose
