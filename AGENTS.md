# Repository Guide for Agents

Guide for agentic coding agents working in the `inkless` repository.

The following requirement levels are used throughout this document to indicate
the importance of a given rule or guideline:

| Keyword            | How to treat it          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| MUST/REQUIRED      | mandatory                |
| SHOULD/RECOMMENDED | deviate only with reason |
| MAY/OPTIONAL       | use judgment             |

## Repository Structure

`inkless` is a fork of Apache Kafka that adds Diskless Topics (KIP-1150). Most
of the tree is upstream Kafka. Which paths are inkless-owned — and which are
upstream files carrying inkless edits — is recorded in
[`INKLESS_OWNERSHIP`](INKLESS_OWNERSHIP). When a task is Inkless-related, work in the
**OWNED** paths first (`@aiven/inkless`).

Note that some diskless logic is **interleaved** into upstream broker classes rather
than confined to an inkless package — e.g. `DisklessFetchOffsetRouter.scala` and
`InitDisklessLog*.scala` are net-new under `core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/`, and
`ReplicaManager.scala`/`KafkaConfig.scala`/`BrokerServer.scala` carry heavy inkless
edits (the dual-owner INTERLEAVED entries in the manifest). Don't assume all inkless
Scala lives under `io/aiven/inkless/`.

Everything else is upstream Kafka. Follow upstream conventions when editing those and
keep Inkless changes minimal and isolated.

### Inkless Documentation

Read these only when a task touches the relevant area. All docs are under
[`docs/inkless/`](docs/inkless/).

Upstream Kafka build, test, and tooling commands are in the root
[`README.md`](README.md). Upstream sync procedures live in
[`inkless-sync/`](inkless-sync/).

### Engineering Rules

**MUST**-follow rules and guidelines for development.

#### Comments

Write self-documenting code. Comments should be rare and explain **why** (a
non-obvious constraint, workaround, or deliberate deviation), never **what** the
code does. Match the surrounding comment density and never restate the code.
